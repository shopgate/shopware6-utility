### Translations

Simple code that requires a few things:
1. The translated file from Shopware 6. Example files are located [here](https://github.com/shopware/SwagLanguagePack/tree/c2fb5d39b9c3313da0916f0356241960ae885bb6/src/Resources/snippet/storefront)
2. Rename output file name on top of the code
3. Run the program
4. Move the output file to `src/locale/`
